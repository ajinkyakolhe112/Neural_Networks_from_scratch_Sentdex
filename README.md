### Why do this course
1. Learning anything is hard. <u>Learning Deep Learning is even harder</u>. Better to master fundamentals on easier material and only then move to more complex topics. Skimming on fundamental foundation knowledge is very harmful. Market needs **good Data Scientists**, not **just good enough**. More a market matures, better we need to be.
2. <u>Great visualizations</u> to build intuition about Neural Networks. Other courses focus either on just slides or just code. They aren't combined with visualizations to improve retention of concepts.
3. Implementing from scratch to build a <u>deeper understanding</u>. This course makes it easy to get started.
4. Course follows philosophy of <u>incremental complexity</u>. It makes learning easier, we start with easier and slowly increase complexity and slowly increase our mastery, eventually everything is easy. Other way is a very steep slope, great if you can complete it, but low probability of actually completing it. That's why a better starting point that Andrew Ng Machine Learning or Deep Learning Specialization
